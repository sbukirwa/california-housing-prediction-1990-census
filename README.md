California Housing Prices Prediction

This project utilizes data from the 1990 U.S. Census to predict housing prices in various districts across California. It demonstrates my proficiency in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning algorithms.
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict housing prices in California using historical census data. The project involves several key steps:

    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset through visualization and summary statistics.
    Feature Engineering: Creating new features, including a correlation matrix to identify key predictors.
    Machine Learning Pipelines: Implementing pipelines for streamlined model training and evaluation.
    Feature Importance: Identifying the 6 crucial features to improve model performance.
    Modeling: Applying and comparing various machine learning algorithms, including:
        Linear Regression
        Random Forest Regressor
        XGBRegressor

Key Features

    Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
    Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and key statistics.
    Feature Engineering: Utilizing the correlation matrix to guide the creation of new features.
    Machine Learning Pipelines: Streamlined process for model training, validation, feature importance and hyperparameter tuning.
    Model Comparison: Evaluating different algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
